```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Using the c() function, create and store two new vectors, called vec_a and vec_b, where a=(1,6) and b=(2,4):

vec_a <- c(1, 6)
vec_b <- c(2, 4)

# Check your by-hand solutions from Part 1 by finding the following in R:

vec_a + vec_b
vec_b - vec_a
4 * vec_a
vec_a %*% vec_b
```
